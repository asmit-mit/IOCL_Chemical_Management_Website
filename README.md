# Chemical Management Dashboard

## Introduction

This project is a web based Chemical Management Dashboard developed as part of my internship. The application is designed to streamline the handling of chemical data, providing an interface for users to manage inventories, track usage, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. The design focuses on a modular architecture to enable scalability and a strong focus on security to protect sensitive data.
