# Chemical Management Dashboard

## Introduction

This project is a web-based Chemical Management Dashboard developed during my internship to streamline the handling of chemical data. The application enables users to manage inventories, track usage, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. It also features trend analysis tools to identify chemical usage patterns, helping determine procurement needs. Designed with a modular architecture for scalability and robust security measures, the dashboard ensures efficient and secure chemical management.
